    "## Dirac Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "A **qubit** is a \"quantum bit\" that owns a state of either 0 or 1. Unlike in the classical interpretaion that the bit should be either 0 or 1 exclusively at a time, a qubit can be \"partially\" 0 and partially 1. We specify the \"partially\" by a complex number called **amplitude**. For example, $|\\psi\\rangle = \\sqrt{0.2}|{0}\\rangle + i\\sqrt{0.8}|1\\rangle$ represents a legal state of a qubit, where $\\sqrt{0.2}$ and $i\\sqrt{0.8}$ are the amplitudes of state $0$ and $1$, respectively. We call this \"$|\\rangle$\" the **dirac notation**, which is widely used in quantum mechanics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the certificate for a legal qubit is that the sqaures of the amplitudes sum up to $1$. There will be no surprise if you know that these factors are essentially the square roots of the probability of each state. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the state is represented by multiple qubits, we need more factors to describe the probability distribution. In gerneral it's $2^w$ factors for a $w$-qubit state. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\alpha|00\\rangle + \\beta|01\\rangle + \\gamma|10\\rangle + \\delta|11\\rangle \\quad \\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma, \\delta \\in \\mathbb{C}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "is the general form for 2-qubit quantum states. A concrete example may be $\\sqrt{0.1}|00\\rangle + \\sqrt{0.4}|01\\rangle -\\sqrt{0.5}|11\\rangle$. For simplicity (arguable), we can also write the bits in base 10, in which case we will have $\\sqrt{0.1}|0\\rangle + \\sqrt{0.4}|1\\rangle - \\sqrt{0.5}|3\\rangle$ for the same example.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we already have two wires each carrying one qubit of states $\\psi_1$ and $\\psi_2$, how can we get the overall state? i.e. how to get the 4 factors out of the original ones? Say $\\psi_1 = \\sqrt{0.2}|0\\rangle + \\sqrt{0.8}|1\\rangle$, $\\psi_2 = \\sqrt{0.4}|0\\rangle + \\sqrt{0.6}|1\\rangle$, the tensor product is helpful here:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    \\psi &= \\psi_1 \\otimes \\psi_2 \\\\\n",
    "    &= (\\sqrt{0.2}|0\\rangle + \\sqrt{0.8}|1\\rangle)\\otimes(\\sqrt{0.4}|0\\rangle + \\sqrt{0.6}|1\\rangle) \\\\\n",
    "    &= \\sqrt{0.2\\times0.4}|00\\rangle + \\sqrt{0.2\\times0.6}|01\\rangle + \\sqrt{0.8\\times0.4}|10\\rangle + \\sqrt{0.8\\times0.6}|11\\rangle \\\\\n",
    "    &= \\sqrt{0.08}|00\\rangle + \\sqrt{0.12}|01\\rangle + \\sqrt{0.32}|10\\rangle + \\sqrt{0.48}|11\\rangle\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that *not* all states can be derived from tensor products. States that can be represented as a tensor product are called **product states**. Others are called **entangled states**. An example of the latter is $\\psi = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}|01\\rangle + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}|10\\rangle$, in which case the measured results of the qubits are dependent on each other (say we get 1 for the first qubit, then it's sure the other qubit is 0)."

    "## Vector Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "Another notation for quantum states is the **vector notation**. Since conventially, each possible state are listed in the increasing order, we can just keep the amplitudes of each state and write them in the vector form. For example, $\\psi = \\sqrt{0.2}|0\\rangle + \\sqrt{0.8}1\\rangle$ can be equivalently written as:\n",

    "Note that in this notation we cannot omit the items with 0 amplitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's natural to consider each possible state as a basic vector, so that the total state can be represented by the weighed sum of these vectors, just like how we interpret a vector in $\\mathbb{R}^k$. For example, for a $w$-qubit state where $w = 2$, we have the following basic vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^{2^w}$:\n",
